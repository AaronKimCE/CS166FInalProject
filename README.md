This is the final project for CS166 Spring 2021 Quarter.
Group Members: Aaron Kim

All code was done by Aaron.

This project simulates a Hospital Database Management System that includes a postgre
database implementation that runs a java script to handle user input and output.
The functions implemented in the java code include:
1). Adding a Doctor to the Database
2). Adding a Patient to the Database
3). Adding an appointment to the Database
4). Booking an appointment for a Patient and Doctor if a searched Appointment is available and updating the status.
5). List the appointments of a Doctor given an ID and a date range
6). List available appointments given a department name and a date
7). Count the types of appointments per doctor listed in descending order
8). Find how many patients per doctor given an appointment status

The functions were implemented using java input and error handling and SQL queries 
given user input.

Function 7 also implements a swapsort method using Lists to sort the output to how we desire it.
